.SH DESCRIPTION
todo is a simple todo list manager written in Bash, using SQLite to store your todo list data.
.PP
Basic informations about your database are available: SQLite database format (sqlmode), date of database creation, todo version used at database creation (if format is to change some day, that will allow continuity, and SQLite version used when database was created).
.PP
~/.todorc file allows you to define the database path (TODODB variable, using Bash syntax), and SQLite options.
.PP
~/.todosqliterc file allows to tweak SQLite output (display is tailored for 132 columns terminals by default). See man sqlite3

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
(none)

.TP
\-a

.TP
\-h

.TP
\-i
Display informations about your todo database (SQL mode used, date of database creation, todo version when database was created, SQLite version when database was created).
.TP
\-n
Create a new task. Argument is task description and must be "quoted". Otherwise, task will be created with only the 1st word of description.
.TP
\-s
Search for unfinished tasks (not marked as completed) containing either '%word%' (*word* in shell equivalent) if database was created using old format, or ' word ' if using FTS3 (Full Text Search) engine of SQLite (most likely the case).
.TP
\-S
Search for still valid and completed tasks containing either '%word%' (*word* in shell equivalent) if database was created using old format, or ' word ' if using FTS3 (Full Text Search) engine of SQLite (most likely the case).
.TP
\-u
Mark a completed task as unfinished. Argument is integer.
.TP

.SH EXIT STATUS
0: Everything went fine.
.PP
1: sqlite3 command could not be found.
.PP
2: SQLMODE (defined in ~/.todorc) has a non valid value.
.PP
3: There was a problem when interacting with SQLite.
.PP
4: Database uses FTS3 SQLMODE, but sqlite3 does not support it (that could happen if you use some kind of cloud to store your todo database, and are in front of a VERY old OS), or if the packager did not compile sqlite3 with FTS support (unlikely)).
.PP
5: There was a problem creating directory destined to store todo database.
.PP
6: Database directory is not writable, so we canâ€™t store todo database there.
