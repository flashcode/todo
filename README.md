## Todo (no pun intented)
- [ ] DEB Packaging.
- [ ] Code cleanup, use local and readonly variables as much as possible.
- [ ] Use proper case for variables (CAP are for exported variables by convention).

## Wonâ€™t implement
- [ ] Allow a category personnal/job for each todo entry. NOPE (too much changes (hint: add a keyword or something in task description.))

## Known bugs
- [x] Import (-t) fails causing loss of database content. Do NOT erase your dump.

todo SQL database is very simple:

info table (single entry) |
------------------------- |
sqlmode (text not null) |
creation (date as text not null) |
todoversion (text not null) |
sqliteversion (text not null) |

todo table (one line per entry) |
------------------------------- |
title (text not null) |
creation (date as text not null) |
completed (date as text) |

date is date +"%Y-%m-%d %R:%S" formatted

rowid is automatically defined by SQLite.
